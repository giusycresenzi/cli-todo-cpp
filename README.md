my first ever C++ project lets go

[D E S C R I P T I O N]
this is a todo list that allows to do some operations to a todo.txt file
the tasks are stored in a temp vector of strings
you can add, delete, search by keyword and other (all commands are shown with "help" command
all changes to this temp vector are saved in the file

executable: ./cli_todo_cpp
